# Java & Data Structures — Skyline College

This repository is my **coursework archive + practice workspace** for **Java** and **Data Structures** at **Skyline College**.  
It includes **Java practice programs**, **lecture slides**, and **my study notes** (PDF/DOCX) organized by chapter/topic.

> ⚠️ **Copyright note:** If any PDFs/PPTX files are instructor materials or textbook pages, it’s safest to keep this repo **PRIVATE**.

## What’s in this repo

### ✅ Java programs (code)
Small programs and practice exercises covering:
- Core Java (variables, loops, methods, input/output)
- Arrays / ArrayLists
- OOP (classes/objects, constructors, overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)
- Exception handling
- Searching & sorting basics
- File I/O (streams, `Scanner`, serialization)

### 📚 Notes (PDF/DOCX)
Personal study notes organized for quick review.

### 🖥️ Slides (PPTX)
Lecture slide decks for Java topics.

## Topics covered

### Java (Core + OOP)
- Constructors & constructor overloading
- Method overloading
- Enums (enumerated types)
- Getters & setters
- Wrapper classes
- Abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism
- Exceptions
- I/O streams, `Scanner`, serialization

### Data Structures / Algorithms (Basics)
- Lists (ArrayList, singly/doubly/circular linked lists)
- Stacks (array-based, linked-list-based)
- Queues (including resizing/dynamic queue ideas)
- Hashing (chaining, HashMap practice)
- Sorting (selection/insertion + tracing merge/quick sort)
- Trees (basic traversal)
- Graph basics

## How to run Java code

### Compile a single file
```bash
javac FileName.java
```

### Run it
```bash
java FileName
```

### Programs with multiple classes
Compile all required files together:
```bash
javac Main.java HelperClass.java AnotherClass.java
java Main
```
